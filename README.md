> A sophisticated trading account classification system combining traditional machine learning with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-accuracy pattern detection and risk assessment.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dual Classification System**: Innovative combination of ensemble ML and LLM-based approaches
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieved 100% accuracy on test set with LLM classifier
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Sophisticated ratio-based features for trading metrics
- **Robust Cross-Validation**: K-fold validation demonstrating consistent performance (Mean CV: 0.941)
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive metrics including ROC-AUC, MCC, and Cohen's Kappa
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Feature importance and distribution analysis
- **Production-Ready Code**: Modular design with comprehensive documentation

## 📊 System Architecture

### Traditional ML Pipeline
```
Data → Feature Engineering → Ensemble Model (RF/XGB/SVM) → Classification
```

### LLM-Based Pipeline
```
Data → Feature Engineering → Embeddings → Nearest Neighbors → LLM Analysis → Classification
```

## 🔥 Performance Highlights

| Metric | Ensemble Model | LLM Model |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Accuracy | 0.952 | 1.000 |
| F1-Score | 0.957 | 1.000 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.982 | 1.000 |
| MCC | 0.901 | 1.000 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Scikit-learn
Hugging Face Transformers
LangChain
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-classification.git

# Initialize classifiers
ensemble_clf = EnsembleClassifier()
llm_clf = LLMClassifier()

# Train models
ensemble_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
llm_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
ensemble_preds = ensemble_clf.predict(X_test)
llm_preds = llm_clf.predict(X_test)
```
